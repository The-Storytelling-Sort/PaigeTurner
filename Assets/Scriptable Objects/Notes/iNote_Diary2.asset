  frontPageText: "A Betrayal and A Conspiracy\r\n\r\nDear Diary,\r\n\r\nThis is the
    last time I will ever write in you. I can\u2019t believe that you betrayed me
    like this. When I wrote that I was longing for Turner to heal, I wanted that
    to be a secret. I have tried so many things to try and help him, but Turner does
    not want to be helped. He wants to be left alone and forget the last few years
    of his life. He cannot be saved from the abyss he has willingly fallen into.
    Your little stunt, diary, was outrageous. What made you think you could heal
    him when I failed? All you did was drive the wedge further between us. I didn\u2019t
    think that it was possible for us to be further apart, but you proved me wrong.
    You betrayed my trust, diary. \r\n\r\nThis is a place where even my most private
    thoughts can be exposed. Even though they are exposed in an abstract manner,
    Turner has lived in this library for so long that he understands what the library
    is trying to say to him. They are in sync, the library and Turner. Sometimes
    I feel like they conspire against me to make me understand Turner. I don\u2019t
    need to understand Turner\u2019s feelings! I am the one in the right here! He
    is being completely irrational and has destroyed himself in the process!\n"
  backPageText: "This is not a way to live. I have had enough of this dreaded place.
    I am an adult. It is time for me to make an adult decision and leave this place.
    The novelty of living in a traveling library has long worn off. Honestly it was
    never there in the first place for me, since this is all I\u2019ve known. I need
    a change of pace. Some place grounded, one where I can set up roots. A place
    without lost causes, secret-exposing libraries, anger, pain. I need to get away
    from here, from all of this. I hope the alone time will help Turner...who am
    I kidding. I hope he rots in this musty place. He has done so many unforgivable
    things that I cannot see a world where I would want to come back here, let alone
    forgive him.\r\n\r\nGoodbye Turner. I hope you finish your quest. Just know that
    your quest will not end until the day you die. This is not the way to live, but
    nothing I say will make you see that. \r\n\r\nEnjoy the abyss,\r\nPaige\r\n"
