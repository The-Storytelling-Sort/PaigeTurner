  frontPageText: "A Cliffside and A First \r\n\r\nDear Diary,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m so
    excited! Today\u2019s the first day that Mom and Dad let me use the World Tree!
    I was so nervous to use it at first, it looked so scary when my parents would
    use it. I didn\u2019t think I would be able to do it, but using the World Tree
    is surprisingly easy! All you have to do is close your eyes and think of where
    you want to go! You don\u2019t even have to think of a specific place or world
    type to travel to, the library will do that for you. So when I pressed my hand
    onto the tree and thought, I want to see the coolest mushrooms ever. \r\n"
  backPageText: "The library took us to a place called Decora, and there were mushrooms
    everywhere! The people lived in mushroom houses, with mushroom trees! There were
    walking mushrooms, talking mushrooms, four-legged mushrooms, and more! It was
    so cool! One of the talking mushrooms, Mushteven, made us the best stew that
    I have ever had. Even Mom said it was one of the best meals she\u2019s ever had,
    and that\u2019s coming from Mom! Dad asked her what her favorite meal ever was,
    and she said \u201CHmm...probably the scrambled Durmocks that you made on Aeres.\u201D
    Turner blushed at that. He\u2019s such a good cook.\r\n\r\nAfter that delicious
    food, and a nap, we went on a hike through the forest. Multiple people said that
    the Harubinian Cliffs had the best view in all of Decora. We got there right
    as the sun was setting, and it was beautiful. The sky was stained red and orange,
    and it lit up huge mushrooms as far as I could see.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the
    best days ever!\r\nPaige\r\n"
