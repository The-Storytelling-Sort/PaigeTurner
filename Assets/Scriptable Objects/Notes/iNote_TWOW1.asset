    his sweat-laden forehead. \r\nAurum sits up in a lush plain, tall grass swaying
    in the wind.\r\n\u201CHow did I end up here?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t\u2026remember\u2026I
    went inside\u2026the fortress\u2026is this\u2026it?\u201D\r\nAurum gets up and
    examines the area. The plain stretches as far as he can see. \r\nThe ground starts
    to shake. Cracks begin to form underneath Aurum\u2019s feet. \u201CCrap crap
    crap!\u201D\r\nAurum runs, but the rupture is faster. It tears the world in two,
    consuming Aurum, and he falls down into the void.\r\n"
