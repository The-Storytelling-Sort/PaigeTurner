  frontPageText: "Day 1--:\r\nAurum lies on the ground. No matter the place, every
    day is the same. Wake up in an unfamiliar place. Find no exit. The world shatters.
    Wake up once again. Aurum doesn\u2019t need to eat or drink. The fortress takes
    care of that for him.  \r\nThere\u2019s no point in exploring. It is pointless.
    Aurum might as well lay down and let the next day consume him. Maybe this will
    end if he lays down and lets it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay -----:\r\nThis maze of glass
    is frustrating Aurum. The fortress didn\u2019t even bother to give him a torch
    for this room.\r\nHe walks forward, instantly hitting his head against a mirror.
    \u201COw!\u201D\r\nHe staggers backward into a second mirror, sliding down to
    the ground. He takes out the letter and rereads it, even though he has memorized
    it front to back.\r\nThe words are comforting. From a better time.\r\n"
