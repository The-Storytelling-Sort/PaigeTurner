    so done with Turner. He dared to write a book about our fight; another terrible,
    post-Mom book. And he had the gall to make himself look like he was the one in
    the right! He makes me look moody, irrational, and angry! I am not moody and
    irrational. I wanted him to join me on my birthday, plain and simple. He responded
    by screaming at me. Of course I responded by yelling back, I wasn\u2019t about
    to let him get away with that without any push back. He made me seem like the
    irrational aggressor, which fits into this narrative of his that I pushed him
    away when he was beaten down. I gave him so many chances, I tried to help him
    again and again, but he didn\u2019t want my help.\r\n"
  backPageText: "He also had to make the story an allegory about some elaborate coming-of-age
    ritual. This ritual, The Spark, causes deep pain within the person who undertakes
    it. The only thing causing me pain on that day was Turner! My 13th birthday was
    not some rite of passage, it was just a birthday. I wanted him to join me, but
    he was so angry that he turned me into an indescribable monster. I hate how he
    perceives himself to be the oppressed one. Turner, according to himself, is the
    rational one who is simply trying to make amends. This is a bold-faced lie. Turner
    is so far gone, so lost within himself, that he no longer sees the same reality
    as me, or anyone else. \r\n\r\nI am past trying to help him. His ignorant and
    skewed worldview makes any attempts at resolution impossible. There is no way
    to bring him back, even though that\u2019s all I really want for him. Even if
    he tries to amend our relationship now, it would not be true reconciliation.
    In order to truly reconcile, he would need to accept reality, something he has
    failed to do for half a decade. I don\u2019t see that changing.\r\n\r\nPaige\r\n"
