  frontPageText: "\u201CI have a job, a plan.\u201D Kay says, \u201CA key was stolen
    from me. One that I will pay well for. I need you to get it back for me. Are
    you in?\u201D\r\nThe Librarians glance at each other. \u201CWhat\u2019s the job?\u201D
    Calloway says.\r\nKay, oblivious to the answer, reaches into her purse and pulls
    out a series of photographs, spreading them out onto the table. \u201CGood. I
    know where it is, too.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is the key.\u201D Kay says, pointing
    to a photograph with the head of a small stone snake. \r\n\u201CThe snake?\u201D
    exclaims Sylvia.\r\nKay points to a second picture, a mansion, the gate has an
    emblazoned logo, Fox Inc. \u201CThis is where my key is. Ephradates. My intel
    team is good. Good enough to get me the layout of the building, including their
    off-limits basement. Get it for me as soon as you can. I\u2019ve left my address
    in the photographs.\u201D Kay pivots away from the Librarians and promptly exits.
    \r\nAs she walks out, Vivian calls out \u201CWe need- nevermind.\u201D\r\n"
  backPageText: "The Librarians turn to each other.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t take her
    to be the type that waits. Let\u2019s get this done.\u201D Vivian says, and walks
    over to the clockwork phoenix, which whirs awake once she enters the World Tree.
    She places her palm on the breast of the bird. Take me to Fox Inc. Vivian thinks.
    \r\nThe library jolts slightly, causing some books to fall off their shelves.
    Bright light starts streaming in from the windows and sounds whoosh in from every
    direction, as if they have forgotten where to go. \r\nThe sounds of whooshing
    change to the rumble as a train. With one final jolt, the library lands in the
    heart of Ephradates.\r\nCalloway adjusts his glasses. \u201CLet\u2019s make a
    plan.\u201D\r\n"
