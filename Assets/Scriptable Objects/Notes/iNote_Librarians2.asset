  frontPageText: "A security guard checks her watch. Bill\u2019s late. Again.\r\nCRASH.
    The front door to the mansion falls to the ground, echoing into the silent night.
    An alarm blares. \r\nWhat the- \r\n\u201CKortney!\u201D Bill calls out. \u201CSomeone\u2019s
    broken through the front door! They\u2019ve entered the building!\u201D\r\nCalloway
    throws the rope over a hanging roof fixture. \u201CThis should be the right window,\u201D
    says Calloway. \r\n\u201CI hope so,\u201D Sylvia says and begins to climb. Calloway
    follows.\r\nOnce Syvlia reaches the third floor window, she pulls out a pen-sized
    device from her pocket. It is a small cylinder-shaped rod divided into two sections.
    She holds one end to the window, and the device begins to softly whirr as the
    other end begins to rotate. The glass begins to crack under the pressure, and
    shatters.\r\n\u201CFind the key for the elevator! I\u2019ll find the button!\u201D
    Calloway commands, as he starts to inspect the walls.\r\n\u201COn it!\u201D Sylvia
    says as she searches through a nightstand.\r\n"
  backPageText: "\u201CGot it!\u201D Sylvia calls out.\r\n\u201CJust in time.\u201D
    Calloway says as he presses a button. A portion of the wall slides to the side,
    revealing an elevator with a locked gate. Sylvia unlocks the gate with her key.
    \r\nThe elevator dings as it reaches the basement, revealing a vault of many
    treasures.\r\n\u201CWe could take all this, ya know.\u201D Sylvia says as she
    rummages through the treasures. \u201CNever have to work another day in our lives.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd
    miss out on all the adventure that life has to offer? Not a chance. Not like
    we need money, anyways.\u201D Calloway responds. \r\n\u201CAren\u2019t we doing
    this for the money?\u201D\r\n\u201CMoney isn\u2019t real. Helping others is.
    Let\u2019s find the key, and get the heck out of here.\u201D\r\n"
