  frontPageText: "There once was a woman who ran.\r\nShe did not know why. She did
    not know where.\r\nThere was no need to have a plan.\r\nShe just needed to go
    there.\r\n\r\nShe could not remember how far she went.\r\nShe could not remember
    how much she spent.\r\n\r\nOne day, she stopped at a creek.\r\nShe stared down
    at its peak, and the water stared back.\r\nAfraid of attack, she broke its contact.
    \r\nIts gaze rippled, but never changed.\r\n\r\nUnsettled, she ran.\r\nShe never
    saw that lake again.\r\n"
