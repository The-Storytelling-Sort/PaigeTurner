  frontPageText: "I am unsure when the Grand Library, as the placard on the entrance
    calls it, came into existence. I stumbled upon it in my travels through northeastern
    Palia. It just appeared out of the blue, right in front of me. I cannot make
    sense of how it travels, or why it came to me, but we have been attached ever
    since. After spending the night in the Grand Library, a new section of the Library
    stemmed from the hub, as if it represents my being there. It is a lovely little
    area, a bit cramped for my tastes though.\r\n\r\nWhen I met Enora, it was a celebration
    of her successes as a war hero. I don\u2019t remember that night very well; it
    was all a blur, but next thing I knew, I invited her to stay in the library.
    The next morning, a new wing had been created. Hers had far less bookshelves
    in it, with a far wider open space. The third wing, however, was created while
    Enora was pregnant, and the newest wing was the prettiest of them all. \r\n\r\nWhat
    intrigues me is that the Grand Library appears to have a mind of its own. Things
    will move around as if they\u2019re responding to my thoughts. Enora is much
    more acquainted with magic, but she still can\u2019t explain how the library
    functions. Even if we leave for several days, the library does not remove or
    alter the created wings, as if it knows they still need to be there. \r\n\r\nWhat
    a fascinating place.\r\n"
