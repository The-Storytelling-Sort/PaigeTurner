  frontPageText: "A Mentor and A Meal\n\r\nDear Diary,\r\n\r\nToday I learned how
    to cook! I used the World Tree and traveled to the kindest chef mentor that the
    library can find. I\u2019m so proud of myself! I did it! I made food! And it\u2019s
    good food too! It\u2019s not the prettiest meal, it\u2019s not even close to
    what Dad would make, but I\u2019m still learning. My new mentor is really sweet
    and has a deep love for their craft. I am so happy that they took me in and taught
    me how to make a meal. I wish that I didn\u2019t have to learn to cook, but Dad\u2019s
    inability to do\u2026well\u2026 anything anymore means I have to fend for myself.
    What really stings is that he was such a good cook. I really doubt that I will
    ever be as good as he is at it, but that\u2019s not the point! Today is the first
    step on my hopefully long journey to learn to cook. I will write the recipe here
    as well, in case I lose my new recipe book!\r\n"

    Fortunes, Ground\r\n2 Tbsp Yellow Miso\r\n1 Cup Palia Greens\r\nPinch of Salt,
    Pepper\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n- Cut open the demonfish. Be careful not to rip its innards,
    as that can be reused for other recipes.\r\n- Place the rest of the fish into
    a pot and let it come to a boil.\r\n- Once boiling, sprinkle in the 3 Tbsp ground
    Eternal Fortunes and the 2 Tbsp Yellow Miso. Stir until fully incorporated.\r\n-
    Chop the Palia Greens into thick pieces, then place into the pot. The greens
    will shrink once cooked, so if you can use more than 1 cup. \r\n- Once the Palia
    Greens are cooked through, crack some salt and pepper on top and mix thoroughly.\r\n"
