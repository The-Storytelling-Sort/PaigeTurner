  frontPageText: "A Numbness and A Wailing\r\n\r\nDear Diary,\r\n\r\nIt still doesn\u2019t
    feel real...I don\u2019t know what to do...It happened so fast\u2026\r\n\r\nI
    can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone. I am numb. I can\u2019t feel. I can\u2019t
    think. I really want to cry, but I can't feel any emotion. There\u2019s nothing
    inside me. Nothing. I can\u2019t feel my body. I can barely move. Why won\u2019t
    my body let me cry? That\u2019s all I need my body to do right now, but it\u2019s
    failing me. It\u2019s easier to write these words than cry, and...that scares
    me. Why can\u2019t I feel?\r\n\r\nThe doctors said there was nothing they could
    do. The first thing we did was tell the Library to take us to the best doctors
    in all the universes, but they could do nothing. It was a disease they had never
    seen before. Nobody has heard of it. How can you die of a disease that doesn\u2019t
    exist? That\u2019s so stupid. \r\n"
  backPageText: "This can\u2019t be real. All I want to do is cry, that\u2019s what
    my body is screaming at me to do, but I can\u2019t. But Dad...I\u2019ve never
    seen him cry this much in my life. His wailing is keeping me up...not like I
    was sleeping anyway. I\u2019m hoping that somehow, by writing in you, I can block
    out his cries and let me survive the night.\r\n\r\nI wish...I wish I could cry
    as he does\u2026\r\n\r\nGoodnight, Diary\r\nPaige\r\n"
