    up to the same place.\r\nThis world is one of ice. Ice covers the floors, the
    walls, the ceilings. Aurum is in a big circular room. \r\nIn the center of the
    room is a person encased in the ice. \r\n\u201CElaine!\u201D Aurum runs up to
    the encasement and bangs his fist against it. \r\nShe doesn\u2019t move. \r\n\u201CElaine!
    Please!\u201D Aurum\u2019s hoarse voice barely makes a sound.\r\nAurum sticks
    the letter on the casing. The floor begins to crack.\r\n\u201CNo no no no no!
    Not now! Please! Not now!\u201D\r\nThe floor shatters, sending Aurum tumbling
    into the abyss below.\r\n\r\n----------------------------:\r\nAurum wakes up
    to an unfamiliar ceiling. This is almost empty room, except for a large sign:\r\nThe
    Neverending Fortress,\r\nFor those who need something new, the fortress will
    find you.\r\nThe world splinters, and Aurum wakes up to another unfamiliar ceiling.
    \r\nThe world splinters again. Aurum wakes u-.\r\nThe world splinters aga-.\r\n"
