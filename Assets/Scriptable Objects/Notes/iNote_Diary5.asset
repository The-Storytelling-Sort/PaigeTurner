  frontPageText: "A Celebration and An Obsession\r\n\r\nDear Diary,\r\n\r\nToday
    is my 13th birthday. This is the second birthday that Dad has forgotten. I miss
    Mom, too, but I have started to recover. Even though I\u2019m reminded of the
    pain every day, it is dulling. Dad, on the other hand, has barely changed. After
    his nights of wailing, he went silent. He barely talks, barely eats, barely does
    anything other than work. Even now, he\u2019s writing another book about Mom.
    \r\n\r\nWhen he\u2019s sleeping, I read his most recent books. They\u2019re not
    good. They\u2019re so obsessed with recording what Mom did on her adventures
    that they often lose the point of the story. His writings used to be amazing.
    Even now, I\u2019ll go into the library, pick out a book I have never heard of,
    and read it. He manages to be so good at every genre...except action. No wonder
    Mom didn\u2019t like his action books.\r\n"
  backPageText: "But Dad shouldn\u2019t be writing books now. He should be here,
    with me. I\u2019ve been trying my hand at baking, and made a birthday cake. My
    first cake! It\u2019s...admittedly rough to look at, but it tastes really good!
    He should be here, trying it with me, rather than writing his next terrible book.
    Over the two years since Mom passed, he has grown progressively obsessed with
    his writings. He needs to snap out of this depression. I will make him snap out
    of it. I don\u2019t want him to miss another birthday.\r\n\r\nWish me luck,\r\nPaige\r\n"
