  frontPageText: "An adventure that has been dementing my memories is of our adventure
    on Luneren, the Dust Planet. \r\n\r\nWhen we left the Library, the dust coated
    our eyes. Blinded by the winds, Enora used her magic to guide us back into the
    Grand Library. \r\n\u201CPeople are like dust.\u201D She told me. \u201CFleeting
    moments cast to the wind. They blend and mix into each other until you forget
    which is which.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut they can be stored, contained in a jar.\u201D
    I responded.\r\nEnora shook her head. \u201CThe jar would be contaminated. No
    single dust particle can be contained, they will mix and mesh with other particles
    until events and memories become one muddled mass.\u201D\r\nI sighed, shaking
    the dust out of my glasses. Enora continued. \u201CThere\u2019s no point in trying
    to contain one piece to be as accurate as possible. The wind will blow. The dust
    will settle.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t follow.\u201D \r\n\u201CPeople, memories
    are fleeting moments cast asunder, my love. Our fates are all the same, we might
    as well embrace oblivion.\u201D\r\n\u201CHoney\u2026 why are you telling me this?\u201D\r\n"
  backPageText: "She laughed. \u201CSand and dust just make me contemplate existence.
    I mean, there is so much of it that it feels infinite. Stars make me feel the
    same way. Its why I love the moonlight so.\u201D\r\n\nI still don\u2019t quite
    know what she meant, but she looked so comfortable with it. Looking back at this
    moment, it\u2019s almost like she knew what would come to pass. How could she
    face oblivion and embrace it with open arms? Fleeting moments\u2026 cast asunder\u2026I
    don\u2019t think I can embrace oblivion with the same self-assuredness as her,
    but this memory keeps coming back to me. TI was hoping that if I wrote it down,
    I would begin to understand her musings, but its only made me more unsure. I
    will come back to it at a later date.\n"
