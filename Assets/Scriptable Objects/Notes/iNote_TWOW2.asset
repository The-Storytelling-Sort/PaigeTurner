  frontPageText: "Day 84:\r\nAurum rereads his letter. It doesn\u2019t feel like
    his writings, even though he knows it is. He stuffs it back into the envelope.\r\nTo
    Elaine, the envelope reads. \u201CHow long ago did I write this?\u201D Aurum
    asks the void.\r\nAurum grasps his lantern and moves forward through this old
    wooden hallway. Cracks in the walls show a pitch black outside, though he doubts
    that it\u2019s the real outdoors. He has been trying to keep track of the time,
    but days and nights flow by with no sense of rhythm.\r\nThis hallway does not
    end. I have to get to Elaine.\r\nThe cracks in the walls grow larger and larger
    the more Aurum walks.\r\n\u201CScrew this.\u201D Aurum finds a large crack in
    the wood and kicks it. The wood shatters, leaving a large hole to the outside.
    \r\nAurum climbs through the hole and steps out. His torch burns bright, revealing
    nothing. Even though he can stand, there is no ground at his feet. He turns around.
    The hallway is gone.\r\n"
