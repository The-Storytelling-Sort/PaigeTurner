  frontPageText: "\u201CFound it!\u201D Sylvia grabs the snake-head key from atop
    a shelf. \r\n\u201CGood. Now let\u2019s get out of here.\u201D Calloway says.
    \r\nAs the elevator climbs to the top, a rumble shakes the building.\r\n\u201CI
    hope Mom\u2019s okay.\u201D Sylvia says. \r\n\u201CShe is. Your mother has defeated
    armies with one swing. This is nothing to her.\u201D \r\nOnce Calloway and Sylvia
    are clear of the premises, Calloway pulls out a tube-shaped device with a hollowed
    out end. He flicks a switch and the device comes to life. He holds it up above
    his head and flicks a second switch. A bright green light shoots out into the
    sky.\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s go. She\u2019ll beat us to the library if we don\u2019t
    hurry.\u201D Calloway says.\r\n\u201CRight!\u201D\r\n"
  backPageText: "Calloway and Sylvia enter The Grand Library to see Vivian sitting
    in a chair, relaxing. \r\n\u201CMom!\u201D Sylvia says, running over to Vivian.
    \u201CHow\u2019d you get back so quickly?\u201D\r\n\u201CMagic.\u201D Vivian
    says with a smile. \u201CNow let\u2019s get that key to our client, okay?\u201D\r\nKay
    puts the snake-head key on a chain and puts it around her neck. \u201CI\u2019m
    not letting this leave my sight again.\u201D\r\n\u201CGood work. Expect more
    from me, when the time comes.\u201D Kay says. \u201CI\u2019ll send someone with
    your payment. Goodbye, Librarians. I have other things to attend to.\u201D Kay
    gets up and confidently walks out of her office.\r\nThe Librarians glance at
    each other, awkwardly.\r\n\u201CWell\u2026that\u2019s that, then\u2026I guess.\u201D
    A stunned Vivian says.\r\n\u201CWhat an exciting adventure!\u201D Sylvia exclaims.\r\n"
